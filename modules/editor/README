This is a console text editor based on the SCREEN package and *KEYBOARD-INPUT*
stream, written by Michael Stoll & Bruno Haible in 1992.

Bruno Haible removed it from CLISP in 1998 because he believed that the
era of console (i.e., non-GUI) text editors (like vi) is over.

Sam Steingold resurrected it as a module in 2010 to give SCREEN enthusiasts
something to play with.

This module is in desperate need of TLC (Tender Loving Care)
and it will not be included in the official distribution
until someone volunteers to worn on it and brings it up to date.
