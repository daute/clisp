All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU clisp or when building
it off the hg (mercurial) repository.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler; for the 'debug_gcsafety' build also a C++ compiler.
    Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      http://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU automake
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * Either an internet connection or a recent copy of GNU gnulib.
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

  * GNU tar (for creating distributable tarballs)
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/

  * GNU Wget
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Building off the git repository
===============================

Start with
  $ git clone git@gitlab.com:gnu-clisp/clisp.git

The repository contains a pre-built 'configure' script, therefore
you can proceed with the usual "./configure" immediately.


Submitting patches
==================

Patches should be submitted at https://sourceforge.net/p/clisp/patches/ .

To produce a sequence of patch files, you can use a shell command like
  $ git format-patch -3

For the style of a ChangeLog entry, see the "Change Logs" section of
the GNU coding standards:
